But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof. A cat may look at a king. St Swithins Day, if thou does rain, for forty days it will remain, St Swithins day if thou be fair for forty days twill rain no more You can lead a horse to water but.. how?. Curses, like chickens, come home to roost When two big bottle deh ah table lil one nah business deh.
