party. Because protecting the security of your account is our primary 
concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account features. We 
understand that this may be an inconvenience but please understand that 
this temporary limitation is for your protection.

In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement, your account access will 
remain limited until the issue has been resolved. Unfortunately, if 
access to your account remains limited for an extended period of time, it 
may result in further limitations or eventual account closure. We
