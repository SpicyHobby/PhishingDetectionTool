Dear jnazario,

As you know, I almost never reach out to you personally with a request to g=
et involved in a debate in the U.S. Congress. However, today I feel I must.

Right now, the telephone and cable companies in control of Internet access =
are trying to use their enormous political muscle to dramatically change th=
e Internet. It might be hard to believe, but lawmakers in Washington are se=
riously debating whether consumers should be free to use the Internet as th=
ey want in the future.

Join me by clicking here -- http://click2.ebay.com/705443.465060.0.68092 --=
 to send a message to your representatives in Congress.

The phone and cable companies now control more than 95% of all Internet acc=
ess. These large corporations are spending millions of dollars to promote l=
egislation that would allow them to divide the Internet into a two-tiered s=
ystem.

The top tier would be a "Pay-to-Play" high-speed toll-road restricted to on=
ly the largest companies that can afford to pay high fees for preferential =
access to the Net.

The bottom tier -- the slow lane -- would be what is left for everyone else=
=2E If the fast lane is the information "super-highway," the slow lane will=
 operate more like a dirt road.

Today's Internet is an incredible open marketplace for goods, services, inf=
ormation and ideas. We can't give that up. A two-lane system will restrict =
innovation because start-ups and small companies -- the companies that can'=
t afford the high fees -- will be unable to succeed, and we'll lose out on =
the jobs, creativity and inspiration that come with them.

The power belongs with Internet users, not the big phone and cable companie=
s. Let's use that power to send as many messages as possible to our elected=
 officials in Washington. Please join me by clicking here right now to send=
 a message to your representatives in Congress before it is too late. You c=
an make the difference.
=3D=3D> http://click2.ebay.com/705443.465060.0.68092

Thank you for reading this note. I hope you'll make your voice heard today.

Sincerely,=20

Meg Whitman=20
President and CEO=20
