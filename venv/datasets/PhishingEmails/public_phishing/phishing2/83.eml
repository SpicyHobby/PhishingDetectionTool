As part of our security measures, we regularly screen activity in the 
PayPal system. We recently contacted you after noticing an issue on your 
account.We requested information from you for the following reason:
<br><br>

We have reason to believe that your account was accessed by a third 
party. Because protecting the security of your account is our primary 
concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account features. We 
understand that this may be an inconvenience but please understand that 
this temporary limitation is for your protection.

restore your account access. We appreciate your understanding as we work to

In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement, your account access will 
remain limited until the issue has been resolved. Unfortunately, if 
access to your account remains limited for an extended period of time, it 
may result in further limitations or eventual account closure. We 
encourage you to log in to your PayPal account as soon as possible to help 
avoid this.
