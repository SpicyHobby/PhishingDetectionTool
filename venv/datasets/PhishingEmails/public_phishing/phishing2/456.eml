Good afternoon, unfortunately some processings have been cracked by hackers,   
so a new secure code to protect your data has been introduced by Visa.  
  
You should check your card balance and in case of suspicious transactions immediately contact your card issuing bank.  
  
If you don't see any suspicious transactions, it doesn't mean that the card is not lost and cannot be used. Probably, your card issuers have not updated information yet.   
That is why we strongly recommend you to visit our website and update your profile, otherwise we cannot guarantee stolen money repayment.   
Thank you for your attention.
