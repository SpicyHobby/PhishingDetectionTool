Dear jnazario,

I'm writing to let you know that the eBay User Agreement and eBay Privacy P=
olicy have been updated, effective immediately for users registering as of =
Nov. 22, 2005, and effective February 1, 2006 for current users.

eBay User Agreement =3D=3D> http://click3.ebay.com/705443.61154.0.40451
eBay Privacy Policy =3D=3D> http://click3.ebay.com/705443.61154.0.40453

The rules and dispute resolution policies you originally agreed to have not=
 changed in any substantive way. The User Agreement has been rewritten, how=
ever, to cover new features such as Reviews & Guides, changes in the collec=
tion of overdue seller fees, and to better meet the needs of our growing us=
er community.

The new Privacy Policy, like the old one, outlines the broad categories of =
information we collect from you based on your activities on the site and pu=
blic data sources. It also now specifically calls out the fact that eBay do=
es not sell your personal information for marketing purposes and directs yo=
u to a page where you can select how you wish to be contacted by eBay. If y=
ou would like to receive advance notice of pricing promotions, events, and =
other updates, be sure to select "Newsletters, promotions, and event notifi=
cations" in your Notification Preferences.

If you accept the new User Agreement and Privacy Policy, you don't need to =
take any action. If you do not wish to accept the new User Agreement or Pri=
vacy Policy, please refer to our Frequently Asked Questions about the User =
Agreement Revision for instructions on what to do.

Frequently Asked Questions =3D=3D> http://click3.ebay.com/705443.61154.0.80=
415

Thank you for using eBay and we look forward to many more successful transa=
ctions!

Sincerely, 

Scott R. Shipman, CIPP 
Senior Counsel, Global Privacy Practices
eBay Inc.
