to belive that your account was hijacked by a third
party without your authorization.

If you recently accessed your account while traveling, the
unusual log in attempts may have been initiated by you.
However, if you are the rightfull holder of the
account, click on the link below, fill the form and then
submit as we try to verify your identity.

If you choose to ignore our request, you leave us no choise
but to temporaly suspend your account.

We ask that you allow at least 72 hours for the case to be
investigated and we strongly recommend to verify your
account in that time.

Thank you for using PayPal!
The PayPal Team
