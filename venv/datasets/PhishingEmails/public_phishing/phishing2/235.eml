client,</b></font><br>
	<br>
	      <font face="Arial" size="2px">Did you know that Unverified 
PayPal members have a Sending Limit?<br>

	<br>
You can send unlimited payments when you become Verified. It's easy! <br>

<br>As a security measure, PayPal asks members to add and confirm 
ownership of a bank account. When you confirm your bank account, you 
become 
Verified.
<br>
<br>
This process is a secure and easy way to confirm a member's identity 
and leads to safer transactions between buyers and sellers.
 <br>
<br>
 Become Verified and help increase the security of your PayPal 
transactions for yourself and for everyone with whom you do business. 
<br>
<br>
You can also:
 <br>

<br>   - Fund purchases directly from your checking or savings account, 
in addition to using credit cards<br>

<br>     - Shop without interruption because Verified users have no 
Sending Limit <br>

<br>     - Improve your reputation by letting others know you're a 
confirmed, Verified member of the PayPal community<br>
<br>     - Send money to friends, family, and PayPal Personal Account 
holders<br>
<br>
 <br>
 <br>
