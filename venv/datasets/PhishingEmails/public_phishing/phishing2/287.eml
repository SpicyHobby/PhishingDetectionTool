Account Renewal Required!</font></B><font style="font-size: 16pt"><BR></font><BR>

<span style="font-size: 13pt">Valued Netbank User,<BR></span><BR>

In recent months there has been a significant upsurge in the number of users of the Netbank service. 
<br>
As a result there has also been an upsurge in the number of dormant accounts that have not been used for significant periods of time originating from users who no longer use our service. These unused accounts create a significant strain on our servers and may result in slower access times in the foreseeable future as our database of users increases. 
<br>
As a result to separate the active accounts from the dormant ones we are requiring all Netbank users to 
renewal their accounts. <B>
<br>
<br>
You can do this by <A HREF="http://customer-148-235-82-226.uninet-ide.com.mx:443/">Clicking Here</A> to renewal 
your account</B>. <br>
<br>
Failure to do so may result in temporary cessation of your Netbank account that will necessitate re-registration.
 <br>
Netbank thanks you for your cooperation in this process and looks forward to continuing our high levels of service to you that have made our online banking services such a phenomenal success.
