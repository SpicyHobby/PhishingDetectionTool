<P dir=ltr>Dear customer ,</P>

done in and from your account . Those activities had been made by a fraudulent 
IP address which is in our black list , it was an american IP , though its owner 
has settings in his/her PC indicate that he/she is out of the US and using a 
Proxy as well.</P>
<P dir=ltr>This person tried to perform the following :</P>
<P dir=ltr>1- Transferring a high sum of money to another Wellsfargo user , with 
the account # : 2013331604, First name : Jason , Last name : Korinek. ( Denied 
)</P>
<P dir=ltr>2- Changing password and other important information. ( Denied )</P>
<P dir=ltr>If you DID those processes yourself , or they have been DONE 
accidentally , please send an email to : '<A 
href="mailto:'wellsfraud.com'">wellsfraud.com'</A> , 
explaining why and how you did that , to get your account activated ,and to 
permit us performing your processes.</P>

<P dir=ltr>----------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P dir=ltr>Q : How my account was accessed without my permission ?</P>
<P dir=ltr>A : Many reasons are available : 1st , some internet sites offer 
illegal contents to attract visitors&nbsp;. And without their permission 
,&nbsp;they place trojans ( a small &nbsp;high-risk program to open ports in 
your PC ) and they can&nbsp;spy on you&nbsp;by that small program to know your 
passwords&nbsp; . 2nd , you may accept files from an unknown person that have 
the same mission . 3rd , you may have accessed your online account via a public 
PC .</P>
