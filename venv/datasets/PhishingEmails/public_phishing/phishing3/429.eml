                <font face="Arial" size="2">

During our regularly schedule account maintenance and verification we have detected a slight error in your billing information on file with Wells Fargo.<br> This might be due to either following reasons:
<br> 
<br><strong><FONT color=red>- A recent change in your personal information (i.e. change of address)</FONT>
<br><FONT color=red>- An inability to accurately verify your selected option of payment due an internal error within
our processors.</FONT></strong>
<br>
 <br>We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in your
				Wells Fargo account from a foreign IP address and we have
reasons to believe
                that your account was hijacked by a third party without
your
                authorization. If you recently accessed your account while 
                traveling, the log
                in attempts may have initiated by you.<br>
                <br>
                However if you are the rightful holder of the account, click on 
                the link below and submit, as we try to verify your account.

investigated and
                we strongly recommend not making any changes to your
