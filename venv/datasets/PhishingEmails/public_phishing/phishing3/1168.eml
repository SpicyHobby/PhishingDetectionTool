<body><p><a><b>Dear BOA Military Cardholder</b></a></p>
<br>Continuous Monitoring is an integral part of Bank of America's multiple layers of security. In addition to other fraud monitoring tools, we can often spot fraud based upon transactions on the card that are outside of cardholders typical purchasing pattern. This allows us to spot fraudulent activity as quickly as possible and acts as an early-warning system to identify fraudulent activity.
<br></br>

<br>During a recent checkout we detected suspicious activity and your Card may have been compromised. Fraudulent activity made it necessary to limit your card for online services. Conform to our security requirements and in order to continue online services with your card, we must validate your identity. Please use our link below to proceed.<br></br>
