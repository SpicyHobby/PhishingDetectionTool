Therefore your account has been temporary suspended. We need you to confir=
m your <br>
identity in order to regain full privileges of your account. If this is no=
t completed<br>
by September 30, 2006, we reserve the right to terminate all privileges of=
 your account<br>
indefinitely, as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes.<br>
