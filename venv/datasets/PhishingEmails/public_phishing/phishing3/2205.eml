<pre>   Dear <strong>United Bank & Trust</strong> Customer,

We recently noticed one more attempts to log in your
<strong>United Bank & Trust</strong> account from a foreign IP
address and we have reasons to believe that your
account was hijacked by a third party without your
authorization.
<br>
If you recently accessed your account while traveling,
the unsual log in attempts may have been iniated by you.
However, if you are rightful holder of the account,
click on the link below, fill out the form and then
submit as we try to verify your identity.

<a href="http://www.501.fr/images/_vti_cnf/UBAT/"> Click here </a> to update your online account.


If you choose to ignore our request, we will have to
temporally suspend your account and conduct further
investigations.

Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.
