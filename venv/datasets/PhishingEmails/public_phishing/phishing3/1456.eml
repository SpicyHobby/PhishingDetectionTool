Ebay is committed to maintaining a safe environment for 
    its community of customers. To protect the security of your account, Ebay 
    employs some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our 
    anti-fraud teams regularly screen the Ebay system for unusual activity.
    <br>
    <br>
    We are contacting you to remind you that on 04 February 2007 our Account Review 
    Team identified some unusual activity in your account. In accordance with 
    Ebay's User Agreement and to ensure that your account has not been 
    compromised, access to your account was limited. Your account access will 
    remain limited until this issue has been resolved.<br>
    <br>
    To secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may require some 
    additional information from you for the following reason:<br>
    <br>
    We have been notified that a card associated with your account has been 
    reported as lost or stolen, or that there were additional problems with your 
    card.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    This process is mandatory, and if not completed within the nearest time your 
    account or credit card may be subject for temporary suspension. <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    We encourage you to log in and perform the steps necessary to restore your 
    account access as soon as possible. Allowing your account access to remain 
    limited for an extended period of time may result in further limitations on 
    the use of your account and possible account closure.<br>
    <br>
    For more information about how to protect your account please visit Ebay 
    Security Center. We apologize for any incovenience this may cause, and we 
    apriciate your assistance in helping us to maintain the integrity of the 
    entire Ebay system.<br>
