I'm sorry I somehow missed that.

- --------------------------
I try and implement aggressive filters
(bogon/flood-blocking/nbar/URPF/anti-spoof, etc.) for my customer
networks. Yes it works for the most part but we occasionally run into
buffer/congestion issues and this is where qos comes to our rescue.

We monitor (proactive approach) our qos policies very closely because
they can possibly work against us given certain (white-list)
application-level data rate that are in use.
