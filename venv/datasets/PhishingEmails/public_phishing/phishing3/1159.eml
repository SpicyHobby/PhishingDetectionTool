Dear user@example.com
,<br><br> 
ANZ is really concerned about our customers' security and therefore constantly elaborates new comprehensive data protection methods.<br><br> 
Lately the unathorized attempts to withdraw cash from the bank accounts have become regular.<br> 
We studied every fraudulent operation with duly care and managed to develop a criteria list, helpful to detect a suspicious operation.<br><br> 
Currently we have developed an electronic bank accounts access security system, which is actually ready for implementation. The system follows the a.m. criteria and in certain situations asks a Secret Question the account holder has to answer.<br> 
Alternatively the current transaction and the current account are blocked unless the payment details are clarified.<br><br> 
We kindly ask you to fill out the Additional Authorization Form, necessary to activate the system.<br><br>
