Good afternoon, unfortunately some processings have been cracked by hackers, <br>
so a new secure code to protect your data has been introduced by visa.<br>
<br>
You should check your card balance and in case of suspicious transactions immediately contact your card<br> issuing bank.<br>
<br>
If all transactions are alright, it doesn't mean the card is not lost and cannot be used. Probably, your card<br> issuers have not updated information yet. <br>
That is why we strongly recommend you to visit our web-site and update your profile, otherwise we cannot <br>guarantee stolen money repayment. <br>
Thank you for your attention. <br>
