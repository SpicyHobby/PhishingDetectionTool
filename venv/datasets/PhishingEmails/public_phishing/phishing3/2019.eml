Dear user,

I'm writing to let you know that the eBay User Agreement and eBay Privacy P=
olicy have been updated, effective immediately for users registering as of =
May 16, 2007, and on July 9, 2007, for current users.

eBay User Agreement =3D=3D> http://click3.ebay.com/705443.69045.0.40451
eBay Privacy Policy =3D=3D> http://click3.ebay.com/705443.69045.0.40453

The rules and dispute resolution policies you originally agreed to in the U=
ser Agreement have not changed in any substantive way. We've made some chan=
ges to this agreement to make sure our legal documents are consistent with =
the ways our sites and services are evolving and to better meet the needs o=
f our user community. You'll notice some changes to our "Content License" a=
nd "Abusing eBay" sections to that effect.

The new Privacy Policy, like the old one, outlines the broad categories of =
information we collect from you, how we use this information, and what your=
 options are with respect to the information we collect. You'll notice a fe=
w changes to the policy, which we've made to cover new programs and site sa=
fety projects we're putting in place.

---------------
Combating Fraud
---------------
We're increasing our efforts to combat fraud on the site with a variety of =
programs. For example, we've made some changes that allow us to address "As=
k a Question" and "My Messages" spam and other malicious activities using o=
ur message systems. And we're making sure our disclosures about cooperating=
 with law enforcement allow us to respond to increasingly sophisticated fra=
udsters and criminals.

---------------------
Streamlining Services
---------------------
We've heard your comments about how many steps it takes to complete a trans=
action or get customer support where multiple eBay companies are involved. =
So we've made some changes that will allow our Customer Support team to hel=
p you with questions that span our companies. And we're streamlining your u=
se of the services provided by members of the eBay corporate family, so you=
r experience across the eBay Inc. platform will be as seamless as we can ma=
ke it. Some of our new programs also mean you'll see eBay services and cont=
ent in a lot of places (not just on the site), so we've made some changes t=
o reflect that.

--------------------------------
Customizing Your eBay Experience
--------------------------------
We're rolling out programs and working with partners that help make our sit=
es and services, and some of the ads you see on the web, more relevant and =
useful to you. Naturally, because we're a transparent community, we'll iden=
tify the new ads served with this program and provide you with choices abou=
t them. Beginning in July, we'll make a new preference available in My eBay=
--named AdChoice--that lets you tell us whether you want us to use the info=
rmation we have about you to customize the ads you see. You'll be able to s=
ign in and change your advertising preferences in My eBay at any time. You'=
ll also notice links on the ads we serve this way, so you'll know an ad is =
served with the new program and be able to set your preferences right from =
the ad.

We hope you'll agree that these changes will make the eBay sites and servic=
es work better for you. If you accept the new User Agreement and Privacy Po=
licy, you don't need to take any action. If you do not wish to accept the n=
ew User Agreement or Privacy Policy, please refer to our Help pages for ins=
tructions on how to close your account.

Thank you for using eBay and we look forward to many more successful transa=
ctions!

Sincerely,

Scott Shipman
Counsel -- Global Privacy Practices
eBay Inc.
