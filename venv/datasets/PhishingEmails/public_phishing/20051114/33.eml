3/14/01: Yay! I finally got this much of the walkthrough done! I still have to
get the Extra endings, but I think I got all the basic endings. Also, I'm still
looking for more Energy Units and side quests! I'll update more soon!

3/17/01: Last night I beat the EX mode! Now I have gotten every ending (I
think) so I'm going to be focusing on getting 100% results and finding anymore
side quests or items. Also, I can now be found browsing the Shadow of Destiny
message boards on www.gamefaqs.com and www.neoseeker.com. Thanks to all the
email I've received since I put this walkthrough up! There is a new energy unit
location, and some new things to do on side quests.

3/19/01: I have all kinds of new things to put up! If there are only 5 Energy
Units in each era, the I've found them all! I'm getting so damn close at 100%s
in most Chapters, it's killing me! At the end of each chapter, I put in a
little "To get higher %s in this section" thing to help people out with their
%s. If I missed anything, please don't hesitate to tell me. A complete
walkthrough is my ultimate goal! Thank you to everyone that's been helping me
by sending in extra hints and tips and stuff. Thanks also for all of your kind
words regarding my walkthrough. You guys are awesome!

3/21/01: Another day, another update! I have some more stuff to put up.
Something in Chapter 2 and something in Chapter 4! Also, by request, I now
include my % completed for each chapter! I'm also just fixing some wording of
other sections too!

3/31/01: More updates! I've become a moderator, I'm so excited! Go to
http://www.neoseeker.com/forums/index.php?fn=browse_forum&f=&d=2360 I'll be
there to answer questions or to talk about the game and stuff! I've also
included a new section for those people looking for each other that have been
making some of us crazy! Well, on with the updating...

4/11/01: Hello again! I finally got another 100%! Although my % in other
Chapters went up too! I'm putting a few things into the walkthrough section and
added to the Fortune Teller tip.

Cellphone - Eike starts the game with this. Although you can't call out to
others, you can recieve a few calls during the game... and maybe something
else.

Lighter - You also start the game with this, and are reunited with it after
a short time. Smoking is bad for you, but what else could you use it for?

Digipad - Given to you by Homunculus, the Digipad allows you to use the time
traveling abilities of the demon to move through eras. The Digipad runs on
energy units, which can be found throughout the game.

Energy Unit - A source of power for the Digipad. Without these, you cannot
move between eras. Later, I might add a list of EU locations, in case you
need to find some in a hurry.

Notebook - When given all this information from several time periods, how can
you be expected to keep it straight? Eike will jot down his thoughts in this,
allowing you to glance at it if you become stuck.

Red Stone - It plays an important part in the game, keep an eye out for this
key item and what you are expected to do with it.

Old Rope - Found in the tower in 2k1, its very old and rotten, not much use.

New Rope - A strong sturdy rope from the tower in the 1800s. Could be useful
for climbing or securing something.

Kitten - Obtained from Mr. Eckert in the present. It would make a nice gift for
someone!

Chocolate Sample - The Baker is happy to give you this in Chapter 3. If you were
feeling awful keen about some girl, I'm sure she'd love some chocolate!

Egg Pocketwatch - Crafted by Oleg's father, it is a handmade watch in the shape of
an egg. A bit gaudy, but its probably worth something...

Scribner's Egg - A fun egg-shaped contraption that you can roll a note up in. If you
wanted to pass someone a letter, this would be a novel container. Looks kind of
valuable too...

(more items to follow!)
