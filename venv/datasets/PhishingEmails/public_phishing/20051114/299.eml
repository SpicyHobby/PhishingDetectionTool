Thank you for writing to Amazon.com to bring this to our attention.

The message you received was not sent to you by Amazon.com.  We are 
investigating the situation and working to get that webpage removed. 
You did the right thing by contacting us.

For your protection, we suggest that you never respond to requests 
for personal information that may be contained in the forged e-
mail.  I've provided some tips below my signature to help you 
identify spoof messages.

I want to assure you that Amazon.com is not in the business of 
selling customer information.  Many spammers and spoofers use 
programs that randomly generate e-mail addresses, in the hope that 
some percentage of these randomly-generated addresses will actually 
exist.

Important Note: If you submitted your credit card number to the 
faked "Amazon.com" web site, we advise that you take steps to 
protect your information by notifying your credit card company.  
Additionally, you should delete that credit card from your 
Amazon.com account to prevent anyone from improperly regaining 
access to your account.  To do so, click the link in your Seller 
Account to "Change your Amazon.com store-wide settings such as e-
mail, address book, and 1-Click."  Then click "Edit or delete a 
credit card" under Payment Settings in Your Account.

Amazon.com has recently taken steps to combat e-mail forgeries such 
as this in the U.S. and Canada; you can read more about our efforts 
here:

http://www.amazon.com/stopspoofing 

I have included more information below my signature to assist you in 
identifying e-mail forgeries. If you encounter any other spoof 
messages in the future, please forward the messages to stop-
spoofing@amazon.com.

Thank you again for taking the time to contact us.

Best regards,

============================== 
Check your order and more: http://www.amazon.com/your-account 

1. Amazon.com will *not* ask you for the following 
   information in an e-mail message:
	* Your Amazon.com password
	* Your bank account information
	* Your credit card information or PIN
	* Your social security number
	* Your mother's maiden name or other information
          to identify you

2. Be on the lookout for poor grammar or typographical 
   errors. Many phishing e-mails are translated from 
   other languages or are sent without being proof-read.
   As a result, these messages can contain bad grammar or 
   typographical errors.

3. Check the return address-- genuine e-mails come from 
   an e-mail address ending in "@amazon.com".

4. Check the Web site address-- genuine Amazon.com Web 
   sites always end with ".amazon.com" -- that is, 
   "www.amazon.com."  We *never* use a combination such 
   as "security-amazon.com" or "amazon.com.biz".

5. When in doubt, go directly to the Amazon.com web site. 
   Some phishing e-mails include a link that looks as though
   it will take you to your account, but it is really a 
   shortened link to a completely different Web site. If you 
   hover over the link in your e-mail client, you often can 
   see the underlying, false Web address, either as a pop-up
   or as information in the browser status bar

6. Do not "unsubscribe"-- many spammers use these "unsubscribe" 
   processes to create a list of valid, working e-mail addresses.
