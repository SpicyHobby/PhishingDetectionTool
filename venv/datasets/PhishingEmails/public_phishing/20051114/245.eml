We recently have determined that different computers have logged into 
your 
PayPal account, and multiple password failures
were present before the login. One of our Customer Service employees 
has 
already tryed to telephonically reach you. As our employee
did not manage to reach you, this email has been sent to your

order to regain full privileges of your account.<br>
If this is not completed by <strong>September 24, 2005</strong>, we reserve 
the right to terminate all privileges of your account

you for your cooperation in this manner.<br>
