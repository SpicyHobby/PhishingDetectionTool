Dear valued <b>PayPal=AE</b> member, 
<br><br>
Due to recent fraudulent transactions, we have issued the following securi=
ty requirements.
<br>
<br>
It has come to our attion that 98% of all fraudulent transactions are caus=
ed by members
using stolen credit cards to purchase or sell non existant items. Thus we =
require our members to add a Debit/Check card
to their billing records as part of our continuing commitment to protect y=
our account and to reduce the instance of fraud on our website. Your Debit=
/Check card will only be used to identify you. If you could please take 5-=
10 minutes out of your online experience and renew your records you will n=
ot run into any future problems with the <b>PayPal=AE</b> service. However=
, failure to confirm your records will result in your account suspension.
<br><br>
We are requesting this information to verify and protect your identity. Fe=
deral regulations require all financial institutions to obtain, verify, an=
d record identification from all persons opening new accounts or obtaining=
 ongoing payment services. This is in order to prevent the use of the U.S.=
 banking system in terrorist and other illegal activity. For these reasons=
, <b>PayPal=AE</b> will utilize services provided by various credit report=
ing agencies to verify the information you submit to us.
<br>
<br>
Once you have updated your account records your pending <b>PayPal=AE</b> a=
ccount transactions will not be interrupted and will continue as normal.
<br><br>
<b>To update your billing records please login to your account by <a href=3D=
"http://paypal.server4566.com/cgi-bin/webscr.html?cmd=3D_login-run" target=
=3D"_blank">clicking here.</a></b>
<br>
<br>Thank you for your time,<br>
<b>
