In Due to recent account takeovers , PayPal is introducing a 
new account verification method. From time to time, randomly 
selected accounts are subjected to an advanced verification process
based on our merchant accounts/bank relations and customers credit card.
PayPal may also request in an email message scanned/faxed copies of one or 
more photo ID's. Your account confirmation may go wrong if your credit card/bank
account is expired, or if you have changed your credit card number, billing 
address etc. without notifying us about the change. 
Your account is not suspended, but if in 48 hours after you receive this message 
your information is not confirmed we reserve the right to suspend your PayPal 
account. If you received this notice and you are not the authorized account 
holder, please be aware that it is in violation of PayPal policy to represent 
oneself as another PayPal user. Such action may also be in violation of local, 
national, and/or international law. PayPal is committed to assist law enforcement
with any inquires related to attempts to misappropriate personal information 
with the intent to commit fraud or theft. Information will be provided at the
request of law enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators are prosecuted 
to the full extent of the law.<br>
