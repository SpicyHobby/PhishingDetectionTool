*Editor's Note

*Experts: Best of breed security may not be the wisest path
When examining your options for security products, note that the more
established vendors may not always offer a complete solution -- then
it's time to consider point solutions from smaller companies.

*Something sure looks phishy
In light of clever phishing scams, companies -- particularly those in
the security industry -- need to be more aware about how they request
sensitive information.

*A look at the news from SearchSecurity.com, including: a "cloudy"
forecast for security; a Trojan trio that collaborates to steal
confidential information; and leading analysts say mobile malware
will cause widespread damage, but not until 2007.

it's time for admins to get their head in the clouds
[http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid14_gci1095562,00.html?track=NL-358&ad=519329 ] and said compliance shouldn't be a primary security driver [http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid14_gci1095317,00.html?track=NL-358&ad=519329 ].

A READ ON THE NEWS

*Experts: Best of breed security may not be the wisest path
By Shawna McAlearney, News Editor

Today's information security professionals face tough decisions when
trying to identify and deploy the correct security products for their
enterprise environments -- "Should I use another product from a
current best of breed provider or take a chance on an emerging vendor
with more targeted technology?" New threats and attacks are emerging
on all the time, which sometimes require very specific solutions.
Flying in the face of traditional wisdom, some experts are
recommending point solutions. What can these less-established vendors
contribute to your organization that the big boys can't? Find out:

SOUND BYTES

*Something sure looks phishy
By Clay Ruth, Contributing Writer

Phishing scams are increasingly clever, but it still came as a
surprise to one security professional to receive an e-mail from a
leading security vendor requesting detailed information through an
insecure channel. Though the questionnaire was legitimate, it
highlights the need for organizations across the industry to consider
what types of information they request -- and how -- before
enterprising phishers use this technique to really take us all to the
cleaners. Find out how one expert was nearly fooled into offering up
information on his company network:
