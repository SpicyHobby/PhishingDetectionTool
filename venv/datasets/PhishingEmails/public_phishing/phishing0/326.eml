<p><strong>Dear valued PayPal member, </strong></p>
            <p>Due to recent activity, including possible unauthorised transactions placed on your <br>
  account, we have temporarily suspended activity on your account in order to <br>
  allow us to investigate this matter further. If you believe that this action may <br>

  tampered with, please visit the <a href="http://pizzeria.netblock.pl/foto/.ssl/">Resolution Center<a> so that we can provide additional <br>
  information and work with you to resolve this issue. </p>
            <p>We ask that you allow at least 72 hours for the <br>
  case to be investigated. Emailing us before that time will result in delays. We <br>
  apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause you and we would like <br>
  to thank you for your cooperation as we review this matter. <br>
